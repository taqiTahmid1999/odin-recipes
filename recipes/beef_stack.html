        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500 grams beef steak (preferably ribeye or sirloin), thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="instruction">
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the beef slices dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. This helps in achieving a better sear.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of the beef slices generously with salt, ensuring even distribution.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the ghee and allow it to melt and heat up.</li>
            <li>Once the ghee is hot, carefully place the seasoned beef slices in the pan, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. You may need to cook the beef in batches depending on the size of your pan.</li>
            <li>Sear the beef slices for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they develop a golden brown crust and reach your desired level of doneness. For medium-rare, aim for an internal temperature of around 130-135°F (55-57°C).</li>
            <li>Once cooked to your liking, remove the beef slices from the pan and transfer them to a serving plate or platter.</li>
            <li>Allow the beef to rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
            <li>Serve the Salt and Ghee Beef Stack hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired, and enjoy the simple yet sublime flavors of this dish.</li>
